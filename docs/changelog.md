## 1.0.1
* Bugfix: Suggestion handler and Solr backend runtimelib configuration issue in tests fixed.

## 1.0.2
* Collection manager improvements: Improved logging.
* Reduced logging level to avoid not helpful noise in the logs.
* Reduced solr calls in Vind updates of documents with nested documents.
* Added the possibility of faceting on nested documents fields.
* BugFix: Error in solr _schema.xml_.**multi stored filter** field was not defined as stored.
* BugFix: solved issue with long queries by using POST method in Solr requests instead of GET.

## 1.0.3
* BugFix: nested document facet queries updated to use `edismax` and added missing parenthesis to nested document search query.
* BugFix: non escaped characters in nested document Json facet query.
* BugFix: changed return type of `searchServer` getById method for annotated java pojos to `BeanGetResult`.
* BugFix: avoid document duplication in index (Solr issue with coexisting documents and documents with nested docs).

## 1.1.0
* Full renaming from reporting to monitoring module.
* First stable version of monitoring model.
* Added monitoring log writer.
* Added monitoring ElasticSearch writer.

## 1.1.1
* BugFix: added mixIn to properly serialize DateMathExpression objects and its sub objects.

* Added monitoring to Index, Real time Get, Update and Delete actions from monitoringServer.
* Added _silent_ option to _MonitoringServer_ allowing to ignore unnecessary exceptions thrown during monitoring, which do not affect
search execution. By default the _MonitoringServer_ silent is set to **false**, and this can be changed with the method _MonitoringServer.setSilent(boolean)_.
